    	The concept of the city of Omelas is purposefully introduced as somewhat fanciful and utopian. As the story goes on, it's made out to be more and more "perfect", entirely devoid of conflict and negativity, until the one contradiction is made. When it's revealed that this utopian situation is entirely dependent on the suffering of one specific individual, it is a stark contrast to the previous narrative of the city. The story effectively asks the question: Is the suffering of one justified by the complete lack of suffering of everyone else? The perfection of this world is only maintainable through this mark against its ideality. The suffering is justified as being all the child ever knew, with citizens attempting to rationalize it by thinking things such as "Indeed, after so long it would probably be wretched without walls about it to protect itâ€¦" (4). Is this rationalization actually somewhat sound? Or, is it simply a stretch?

      Here, the majority is unable to bring themselves to break away from the otherwise perfection of their city and the otherwise perfection of their personal life to do anything to stop what they know goes wholly against their ideals and the niceless applied to everyone else. Could you sit by knowing your happiness is not only conditional in this way, but could disappear overnight? If you could not, how would you rationalize it? Ignoring oneself, the story also poses the idea of another third party: The comparison of the suffering child in the basement to the carefree flute-playing child in the field. The inhabitants of Omelas know that should they do anything to combat the misery of the prisoner, not only would their own happiness go away, the happiness of others is also dependent on this imprisonment and therefore would be taken away from them. If you would give up your own happiness depending on this child's misery, would you also be okay with taking that same happiness away from others, complicit or not?

      At the end of the story, it introduces the titular concept, "The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas." These people, not being able to live with what they know, simply leave the city, refusing to associate with those who propagate the facade of Omelas. The thing is, this in reality does nothing to stop the injustice. <b>While it is certainly not nothing to refuse to knowingly contribute to this injustice, their actions all fall short of actually helping.</b> Do you think that simply walking away is enough? After all, nothing changes about the child's situation. They likely don't even know that this is going on.
